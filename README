###     version 0.01 23 Feb 2011 -      made it slightly faster, maybe?
###     version 1.00b 03 Mar 2011 -     Added ability to handle lines where the consensus differs from the reference.
###     version 1.01b 09 Mar 2011 -     Fixed a bug when the sequence line contains only Ns.
###     version 2.00b 11 Apr 2011 -     Reduced memory use, added output fields, fixed bug related to ^$.
###     version 3.00b 14 Apr 2011 -     Added section displaying the differing reads and their qual scores.
###     version 3.01b 15 Apr 2011 -     Explicitly undefined variables, which maybe helps memory usage.
###     version 3.02b 18 Apr 2011 -     Prints a shortened but otherwise unmodified reads line.
###     version 3.03b 29 Oct 2013 -     Modified to work with mpileup output
### Purpose: Calculates the proportion of reads at a position
###     that differ from the majority.
### Syntax: polymorphic_read_counter_bwaPileup.pl [filename]
### [filename] must be a file in samtools mpileup format.
### Output is tab-delimited file with:
### Name, pileup position, reference base, proportion of non-consensus reads, number of reads, consensus base, differing bases (may be blank), their qual scores (may be blank), all bases, all qual scores.
